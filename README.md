# Daily-Motivational-Quotes-RCT

Motivation is a key factor influencing productivity and well-being, and this study seeks to understand whether receiving daily motivational quotes via email can enhance self-reported motivation levels at the end of the day. Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the experiment examines the causal impact of motivational messaging by comparing participants who receive the quotes to those in a control group with no such messaging. The research aims to answer whether daily exposure to motivational quotes leads to higher motivation levels, with the hypothesis that the former group will report greater motivation. Additionally, the study explores whether factors such as age, gender, occupation, first language, or day of the week influence the effectiveness of the quotes in boosting motivation. The findings could offer valuable insights into how simple interventions like motivational messaging might be leveraged to improve daily motivation and productivity across diverse demographic groups.
